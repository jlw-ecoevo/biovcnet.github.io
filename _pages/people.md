**Bio:** I’m a microbial ecologist/bioinformatician at NASA’s Ames Research Center in northern California, USA. I get to work in all kinds of different systems ranging from the bottoms of our oceans up to the International Space Station 👽. Having [gone through it myself](https://astrobiomike.github.io/about/){:target="_blank"}, I very much enjoy trying to help folks get through the initial steep learning curve that lots of us face when we start getting into bioinformatics. In addition to regularly helping to organize and teach at bioinformatics workshops such as [STAMPS](https://mblstamps.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [ANGUS](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/){:target="_blank"}, I develop and maintain [Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, a site that aims to be a useful resource for biologists who are new to bioinformatics 🙂

**Bio:** The battle between microbes and their viruses is ancient and ongoing. Over billions of years of coevolution, microbes have evolved a great diversity of strategies to protect themselves against viral infections. What drives selection favoring a particular antiviral defense strategy? What new defense systems are still waiting to be discovered? How do defense systems coevolve with pathogens over time, and how does this coevolution feed back into the dynamics of host-virus interactions? The central theme of my previous and ongoing work is the application of tools from the fields of machine learning and complex systems science, alongside more traditional approaches from population genetics and theoretical ecology, to understand the ecology and evolution of antiviral defense strategies.

**Bio:**  I am a geomicrobiologist combining a background in geoscience with a diverse toolkit of novel molecular methods, sequencing analysis, and bioinformatic tools to delve into the interactions between the biosphere and geosphere. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Earth and Planets Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution for Science working on the NASA Astrobiology Institute ENIGMA Project.

**Twitter:** @ashbc1988

**Bio:**  I am a PhD candidate in biogeochemistry at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University, NY in Dr. Gordon Taylor’s Marine Microbial Ecology laboratory. I specialize in the geobiology, or the interaction of geochemical processes and microbes, of oxygen-free environments. My dissertation work at Fayetteville Green Lake, NY, is focused on how the succession of microbial carbon fixation pathways and sulfur metabolisms along redox gradients influences stable isotope signatures. I am especially interested in how they are compartmentalized into suspended and sinking particulate matter in the water column, and ultimately, what is incorporated into sediment. I hope this will provide insight into which early earth anoxic water column processes are reflected in the geologic record. I combine microbiology techniques including Illumina sequencing, stable isotope probing, radiotracer rate measurements, qPCR, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with geochemical techniques to answer these questions.

**Bio:** I love viruses! Except for Coronaviruses. I don't love those. I'm a jack of all trades working on bacteria and viruses in the ocean and in soil. I live and breathe metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and stable isotope probing, but dabbled in amplicon work in the past. Most of all I like to know everything about interactions between viruses and their hosts, and some day it will be my main field. For now I'm a postdoc in Mary Firestone's lab. Show me your cats and dogs and we will be the best of friends.

**Bio:** I am bioinformatician at the University of Montana. My research interests span from geomicrobiology to bacterial endosymbiosis. My current research involves using a variety of phylogenetic approaches, as well as functional annotation, comparative genomics, and transcriptomics to better understand genomic and cellular adaptations of bacteria as they transition from a free-living to an intracellular lifestyle. I am also very interested in functional annotation more broadly, and currently developing a bioinformatics platform to allow researchers to carry out a more-targetted approach to functional annotation, using smaller and more-curated datasets that address specific questions or pathways (e.g. biofilm formation, motility, iron cycling, magnetosome formation, etc.).

We use a variety of techniques to answer our research questions including targeted amplicon sequencing, metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing, and metabolomics. Our current focus is on glacial ecosystems in Iceland and Greenland.

**Bio:** I am postdoctoral researcher at The Ohio State University in the Colleges of Public Health & Veterinary Preventative Medicine. My current research uses -omic tools to investigate strain level overlap between humans, animals, and the environment, as well as to reconstruct chemical/xenobiotic microbial pathways in the human and animal gut as it relates to health & disease. My PhD work focused on microbial xenobiotic metabolisms in hydraulically fractured oil and gas systems. I am eager to help people who don't have coding or bioinformatics backgrounds learn their way around the command line for their work, particularly for metagenomics and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis.
